# My Software Development Portfolio Website

## About the Project

I created this website to showcase personal projects and skills
on my road to becoming a software developer. 

## Technologies Used

React, HTML, and vanilla CSS. The JavaScript was linted using
eslint and the css using stylelint.

### Approach

My intent in organizing and creating the website was to
create a website that was easy to add content as I built more
projects. Further projects can be added to the data.js file which
in turn will be rendered. I also wanted to build the website with
vanilla CSS for practice. 

### Status

Completed until additional content is added.
